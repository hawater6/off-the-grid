            <p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 20px;">The very first thing you’ll need to consider for living off the grid is a good location because your land is the foundation of your off grid life. Next, it’s a good idea to choose which type of shelter you will build or buy long before actually moving onto your land. For water, you will most likely not have access to city water or municipal county water sources on your land, so you must choose a piece of land with a natural water source or where it’s convenient to haul water or dig a well. Off grid living means living as self-sufficiently as possible. Creating your food source is a big part of that, especially since you likely won’t have easy access to grocery stores and convenience stores. Since you will not be connected to the electrical grid, you will need to be able to generate electricity yourself. This means having a power generating system with backups that can provide you with all the electricity you need to run all your appliances. Then, at the end of the day you need a power storage system to keep your house running all night. Heating and cooling your off grid home ties in with power generation and are essential factors to consider that depend on your climate and home size.You’re going to have to deal with waste disposal. You’ll need some sort of composting waste disposal system or a traditional septic system.When living off the grid, it’s essential to have a reliable communication system in place. Additionally, security is crucial when living off the grid. You’ll need to protect your property from intruders and wild animals, so investing in security cameras, motion sensors, and other security measures can be very beneficial. Perhaps the most important thing you need to live off grid is the mindset and the will. It’s easy to talk about and say you’d love the off-grid lifestyle, but it takes hard work to actually go through with it.</p>
