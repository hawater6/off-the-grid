            <p>So, you want to know how to live off the grid. It’s simple, really. Move to the woods, build a cabin, throw on some solar panels and a wind turbine for power, and drill a well. Then start raising chickens, cows, and pigs, start a garden, and sit on your front porch while sipping coffee and staring out at the beautiful natural wilderness around you. Easy, right? Not exactly.</p>
            <p>It takes planning, preparation, and work to move off grid. And once you’re there, the work will continue with the maintenance and upkeep of your homestead.</p>
            <p>Let’s make this as simple as possible by breaking down, step-by-step, the most important things you need for off grid living. It all goes back to the basics. </p>
